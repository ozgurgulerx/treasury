# Trade Finance & Letter of Credit Automation

International crude procurement and product exports rely heavily on trade finance instruments. AI with OCR and NLP can automate document-heavy workflows, reducing processing time from days to minutes.

## The Challenge

Trade finance in oil & gas is notoriously complex:

- **Document-intensive** - LCs require multiple documents (bills of lading, invoices, certificates)
- **Error-prone** - Manual checking leads to discrepancies and delays
- **Time-sensitive** - Delays cause demurrage costs and working capital drag
- **Compliance-heavy** - Sanctions, UCP 600 rules, anti-boycott requirements
- **Multi-party** - Banks, shipping, insurance, customs coordination

A single discrepancy in LC documents can delay payment by days or weeks.

## AI Solutions

### LC Document Processing
AI with OCR and NLP automates extraction and validation of data from:

- Bills of lading
- Commercial invoices
- Certificates of origin
- Insurance certificates
- Inspection reports
- Packing lists

**Processing time:** Days → Minutes

### Discrepancy Detection
ML algorithms automatically check trade documents against:

- Letter of Credit terms
- UCP 600 requirements
- Sanction clause compliance
- Anti-boycott language requirements
- Port names and cargo descriptions

Discrepancies are flagged with specific explanations before bank submission.

### Vessel & Shipment Tracking
AI integrates AIS (Automatic Identification System) vessel tracking data to:

- Monitor crude and product shipments in real-time
- Predict arrival times with accuracy
- Automatically update financial systems for payment scheduling
- Detect route anomalies that may indicate issues

### Bank Guarantee Management
Automated tracking and management of:

- Guarantee expiration and renewal alerts
- Commission calculations
- Utilization monitoring
- Compliance with facility limits

### SWIFT Message Processing
AI parses and processes MT 700/799 messages, automatically:

- Extracting LC details
- Populating treasury systems
- Matching to expected transactions
- Flagging amendments or discrepancies
